                                Passwords are never sent to our servers. We only store encrypted text - which is useless data once a password is lost. Also, we don't know who this text belongs to.

                                Your password never leaves your device. We only store encrypted content. You don't have to trust us, or anyone else with your password, since only you know it and only you can decrypt your notes.

                            <p class="faq-answer"> <span class="bold-span">A:</span>
                                It's simple: Open your site with Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox and save the site before decrypting it (Ctrl + S should work). Make sure to save the site while 'Password required' dialog is still visible. To open your encrypted backup, open saved .html file and type in your password.
                            </p>

                            <p class="faq-answer"> <span class="bold-span">A:</span>
                                Some characters aren't allowed in URL addresses, that's why your URL is redirected to a URL that has some characters replaced with dashes. You can always type in <span class="italic-span">&quot;Mark's notes&quot;</span> and you'll be redirected to the same URL.
                            </p>

                                You can add the password after the URL of your site, like this: <span class="italic-span">ProtectedText.com/yourSite<span class="bold-italic-span">?yourPassword</span></span> which will automatically decrypt yourSite with yourPassword.

                                    Evernote is far from secure, and their <a href="https://evernote.com/legal/privacy.php">Privacy Policy</a> says

                                <p class="faq-answer"> <span class="bold-span">A:</span>
                                    You don't have to, but it's recommended. The longer the password, the harder it is to guess it. Note that your text is protected by both the URL and your password.

                                <p class="faq-answer"> <span class="bold-span">A:</span>
                                    Yes. Your password (or password hashes) are never sent over the network, and all data that's sent or received is always encrypted. Your data is decrypted only on your device, and encrypted before it's returned to us.
                                </p>

                                <p class="faq-answer"> <span class="bold-span">A:</span>
                                    The server doesn't know anything about authentication; that's all handled in your browser. There are no users on ProtectedText.com, just sites. Passwords are never saved; not even within encrypted text.
                                    <br />
                                    Decryption of a page will fail if the password is incorrect, so whoever can decrypt the page must have used the correct password. The idea is that we don't have to know the password; we just have to make sure that the password is correct - and one way to check that is to try decrypting some well-known text using the provided password. The &quot;well-known&quot; text we're using is the URL of the current site (which is different, but known, for each site).
                                    <br />
                                    Once a user creates the password, we store the encrypted URL, and each time the password needs to be tested, we just try decrypting the encrypted URL. If we get the expected URL, we try using the same password for decrypting the whole site (it's possible -- but very unlikely -- that two different passwords correctly decrypt the same URL, but using that wrong password for decrypting everything else will result in gibberish).
                                </p>

                                <p class="faq-answer"> <span class="bold-span">A:</span>
                                    Overwrite protection prevents you from saving any changes if text was changed in the meantime. (The server stores the hash of the newest content, and sends the hash to the client together with the content. The client has to return that same hash when trying to save updated content. The server compares both the stored and received hashes to determinate whether client was served with the latest changes.)

                                    ProtectedText.com uses standard AES algorithm for encrypting/decrypting the content, together with 'salts' and other known good practices to achieve exceptional security; and SHA512 algorithm for hashing. On top of that, all data is only provided through SSL.
                                </p>

                                <p class="faq-answer"> <span class="bold-span">A:</span>
                                    We haven't opened the server code, for now. We'd like to provide perfect security to everyone, not just tech users. So we've created this approach where server side is irrelevant - that's the beauty of this service.
                                    <br />
                                    Nobody should be forced to trust anyone in order to be secure; that's why all security is provided from the client side (which users can verify). Even if you knew the server code, you couldn't confirm whether that code was running on server, or if it was replaced by something else. In other words: whenever a server's code is responsible for providing security, you have to trust whoever runs it.

                                <p class="faq-answer"> <span class="bold-span">A:</span>
                                    Sites aren't deleted automatically. We'll keep them until you delete them yourself.

                                    All that we have are encrypted versions of notes that you store on our servers, so once you delete your notes, that's it; there is nothing more to destroy.
